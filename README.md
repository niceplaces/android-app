This project was born in 2018 from the idea of two students from Siena, Italy.  Our mission is to create a mobile application to help users discover historical and cultural places of interest in their vicinity and to provide brief information about them.

*Nice Places is available as [Android app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.niceplaces.niceplaces) and as a [progressive web app](https://www.niceplaces.it/en/app/) in both Italian and English.*

In 2022, the project became open source to allow anyone to contribute.
